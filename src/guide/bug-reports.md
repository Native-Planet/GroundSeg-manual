# Bug reports

This document describes how to use the Bug Report feature in GroundSeg. 

![](/static/bug-reports.png)

Navigate to the Bug Report menu by clicking the bug icon at the top right corner of GroundSeg's web interface.

You can use the bug reports feature of StarTram to submit a collection of logs and system information to Native Planet for analysis. Our devs will receive your report in their email and reach out to you with assistance as soon as they're able.

Native Planet takes privacy seriously, so we don't scoop up your ship's logs by default. You can manually select logs from any piers that you wish to include in your bug report. It will copy the last 1000 lines from the ship's logs (note that ships in [dev mode](/guide/devmode.html) do not save logs for GroundSeg).

Include a way to contact you, like your `@p` or email address, and any additional notes or context, like what exactly the problem you're having is. The more specific you are, the better.
